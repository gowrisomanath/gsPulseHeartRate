A library and test program I created for the Pulse Heart rate sensor.
Developed using the Intel IoT Dev-Kit for the Galileo/Edison boards.

The library is made  of gsPulseHeartRate.h and gsPulseHeartRate.cpp.
See the header files for details on the functions and usage.

gsPulse.cpp shows a test program demonstrating how the library can be used.
